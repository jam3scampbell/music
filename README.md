# Command Line Music Player

A true hacker must never touch the mouse. This script provides terminal commands that emulate a Spotify-like music player. Songs are saved as YouTube links in txt files. Each txt file is a playlist.

## Setup

### Prerequisites
```bash
# On macOS with homebrew:
brew install mpv youtube-dl socat

# On Ubuntu/Debian:
sudo apt install mpv youtube-dl socat
```

### Installation
1. Make the script executable: `chmod +x music_player.sh`
2. Create a playlist file named `playlist.txt` with format:
```
song_label | https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=...
another_song | https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=...
```
3. Source the script: `source music_player.sh`
4. (Optional) Uncomment the MUSIC\_DIR variable in `music_player.sh` and set it to the absolute path of the music directory if you want to be able to run music commands from anywhere. By default, you can only run them in the directory containing the playlists.

## Using Playlists

### Playlist Format
Create playlist files (*.txt) with this format:
```
song_name | https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=...
another_song | https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=...
```
- One song per line
- The name of the song can be whatever string you like
- Use | to separate label from URL
- Labels can contain spaces
- URLs must be valid YouTube links

### Managing Multiple Playlists
- All playlists are .txt files in the same directory
- Switch between playlists using `msw` or `switch_playlist`
- Create new playlists using `create`
- Edit playlists with any text editor

## Live Status Display
Press `ms` (or `show_live_status`) to see:
```
Now Playing: Current Song Title
[1:23 / 3:45] [===============>                    ]
```
- Shows current track name
- Shows time position / total duration
- Shows visual progress bar
- Press 'q' to exit display

## Tips
- Partial matches work for song labels (`mx dra` finds "drake")
- Live status (`ms`) is great for longer tracks
- Run `help` to see all commands and examples

## Troubleshooting
- For socket errors, try `stop_playback` first
- If live display looks wrong, resize your terminal window

## Getting Help
Run `help` in the terminal to see:
- All available commands
- All aliases
- Usage examples
- Tips and tricks

Run `hlp` to get a concise shortcut to see the available aliases.
